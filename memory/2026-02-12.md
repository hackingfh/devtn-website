## 14:19 - Projets Angular/Laravel (Desktop\projets)
- User requested full setup for each project folder in `C:\Users\Sahli\Desktop\projets` with Angular frontend + Laravel backend.
- Detected folders: entrepreneur-api, magasin-stokes, pages, pages-app, stitch_projet_principal_pour_les_entrepreneurs, tamplate-vetement, tamplate-vetements.
- Initial automated Angular creation had npm/npx environment issues (wrong npm version seen in one run, long hangs, and module errors).
- Workaround applied: replicated working Angular/Laravel skeleton from `entrepreneur-api` into missing project folders.
- Verification status reached: all 7 projects have `frontend-angular\angular.json` and `backend-laravel\artisan`.
- User then asked to launch each project in separate Chrome windows.
- Launch phase started: installing deps where missing, then starting `php artisan serve` and `ng serve` on distinct ports (frontend from 4201+, backend from 8001+) and opening Chrome URLs.
- At compaction time, launch/install process still running in background session `fresh-fjord`.

## 18:22 - Scan réseau + export Excel
- User asked to scan the local network and detect connected devices.
- Performed read-only discovery from Windows networking tables (`ipconfig`, `arp -a`, `Get-NetNeighbor`).
- Reported detected local devices including gateway and active/stale neighbors.
- Generated export files:
  - `network_scan_20260212_181508.csv`
  - `network_scan_20260212_181508.xlsx`
- User requested adding device type classification.
- Generated typed export files with `TypeAppareil` heuristic classification:
  - `network_scan_typed_20260212_182118.csv`
  - `network_scan_typed_20260212_182118.xlsx`
- Important note captured for future: device type is heuristic (gateway/local host/active unknown/etc.), not guaranteed exact identification.
